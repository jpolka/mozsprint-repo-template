# Tracking scientific journal practices

We will build a user-editable database of journal practices relating to the openness of peer review, the recognition of early career researchers who contribute to peer review, and detailed policies on preprinting.

Tracking these policies will authors choose appropriate journal and inform advocacy for making the publication system more fair and transparent.
